# Quizemon
The goal of quizemon is to create a quiz game where questions are found on different geolocations.
 
## Rest API's
The application is divided into two API's, one for the game and one for administration. To be able to run the API's
you need to have an ArangoDB database running on port 8529 (can be changed within the class ArangoConfiguration present
in both API projects). If you do not have an ArangoDB instance installed you can find instruction on how to install one
here: 

https://docs.arangodb.com/3.3/Manual/GettingStarted/Installing/

Another solution is to run the docker image provided here:

https://hub.docker.com/r/arangodb/arangodb/
